                            <p>The first certific I would like to share is the Data Structure and Algorithms from Udemy. 
                                Completing a Data Structures and Algorithms certificate strengthened my problem-solving abilities and significantly improved the way I approach coding challenges. 
                                It helped me write more efficient, organized, and scalable code by reinforcing key concepts such as algorithmic thinking, time complexity, and data organization. 
                                This experience has made me more confident when tackling complex problems and building reliable software solutions.</p>

                            <p>The second certific I got is the MySQL/PostgreSQL, which helped me develop a strong understanding of relational databases and data management. Through this certification, 
                                I learned how to design efficient database schemas, write complex queries, and manage data reliably. 
                                It strengthened my ability to integrate databases into applications and build data-driven solutions. </p>
